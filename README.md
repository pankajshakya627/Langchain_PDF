# AI-PDF Assistant

Example of working with ChatGPT API +  LangChain + HugginhFace APIs

## To use this code
1. Need ChatGPT APIs
2.  HugginhFace APIs

Create a file name .env and store the API as follows

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openAI_APIs

HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_APIs


This project focuses on leveraging the power of OPENAI APIs, HuggingFace API, Python Langchain, and Streamlit to create a PDF question-answering application. The objective is to extract text from PDF documents, utilize Language Models (LLMs) to generate accurate answers to user queries, and present the results in a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- OPENAI APIs: The OPENAI APIs provide access to powerful language models, enabling natural language processing and generation tasks.
- HuggingFace API: The HuggingFace API offers a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing tasks.
- Python Langchain: Python Langchain is a library used for text extraction and processing from PDF documents.
- Streamlit: Streamlit is a user interface framework for Python that simplifies the development of interactive web applications.

## Project Workflow

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: The project starts by utilizing Python Langchain to extract text from PDF documents. The library provides efficient methods to parse and extract text content from PDF files.

2. **Question-Answering with LLMs**: The extracted text is then fed into Language Models (LLMs) using the OPENAI APIs and HuggingFace API. The LLMs process the input and generate accurate answers based on the user's queries.

3. **Streamlit User Interface**: The project utilizes Streamlit to create a user-friendly web-based interface. Users can input their questions and receive answers generated by the LLMs. The interface provides a seamless and interactive experience for querying PDF documents.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.
3. Set up the necessary credentials and access tokens for the OPENAI APIs and HuggingFace API.
4. Configure the Streamlit application to connect with the LLMs and enable PDF text extraction.
5. Run the Streamlit application to launch the user interface.
6. Access the application through the provided URL and interact with the PDF question-answering functionality.
